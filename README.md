Despite the fact that the free fall of the Lebanese currency exchange rate, has had severe negative impact on the economy, illustrated by the sharp increase in prices, this free fall could create an opportunity for the Lebanese industry to evolve and gain new momentum. In fact, the sharp increase of prices of imported products makes it almost impossible for ordinary consumers to buy as they used to do prior to the crisis, hence the need for cheaper local alternative goods (many of which are virtually inexistent). Also, the decrease of production costs (in US$) of Lebanese goods provides an opportunity for manufacturers to increase their level of exports to foreign markets, an act which would help eliminate gradually trade deficit as new markets start importing cheaper Lebanese goods compared to similar goodsâ€™ prices in these markets.
